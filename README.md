When you open the page you're automatically in the "home" tab page where you can see all your onging projects.

In this home tab there should be an "all projects" tab, a "today" tab, "week" tab and and importance tab.
The first three are obvious what they do and the importance tab shows all the projects the order of importance so the first project in the list is the most important one.

There should be an add project button.

Each projects (we can call a project for a todo item) should include the following: 
A title, description, dueDate, importance (not important, important, really important), a note, and a todo list aka checklist.

Features
Use a colorful theme.
The mark color of a text should be something else than the default color. It should work with the color theme.
There should a language button that changes the webpages between swedish and english.
