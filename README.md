# Todo-List

<b>First of all - in this project Im supposed to practice OOP. So Ill have the design simple and clean and focus on implementing a JS that robust and works great. Advanced features and CSS is for later projects.</b>

## Inspiration
- https://todoist.com/sv


## Notes

- Design should be simple with a header and title. A left div with navigation list (home, today, week, projects, add button). A right div with all the content and a footer with link to Github.

- When you open the page you're automatically in the "home" tab page where you can see all your onging projects.

- There should be an "all projects" tab, a "today" tab, "week" tab and an importance tab. The first three are obvious what they do and the importance tab shows all the projects in the order of importance so that the first project in the list is the most important one.

- There should be an add project button.

- Each project (we can call a project for a todo item) should include the following: A title, description, dueDate, priority (not important green, important yellow, really important red), and a todo list.

## Features
- Use a colorful theme.
- The mark color of a text should be something else than the default color. It should work with the color theme.
- There should a language button that changes the webpages between swedish and english.
